## What is NLP?

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a set of techniques for approaching text problems. This page will help you get started with loading and cleaning the IMDB movie reviews, then applying a simple [Bag of Words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model to get surprisingly accurate predictions of whether a review is thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

Score: 0.84440.
